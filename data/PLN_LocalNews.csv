All discussions with SLLC have hit this same vital issue – funding.&#34;",55.583333,-3.833333,"

On 12 October, Barnet and Lambeth councils will both meet to discuss schemes to save public libraries – by making them much smaller, and expecting users to shift for themselves. Opposition to the scheme is strong in both boroughs … I’ve seen some dreadful ideas in my time, but this is a whole new horror. All five libraries under threat are packed all day with free activities for all ages. With no staff, all this will go. They’ll be zombies – they’ll look a bit like libraries, but they will be dead. And there will be nobody to safeguard children, help people use the computers or find information. Older people, disabled people, those with little English – in a deprived borough like Lambeth there’s a long list of people who often need support using a library.

We were clear this year that the budget proposals must not include any library closures. It has been really difficult to achieve that and whilst sacrificing library opening hours is disappointing it has saved all of our libraries from closure.

The eight-week consultation will start on Monday 1 February and all comments will be considered before the council decides later in the year on whether to put the library offer&#8230;",51.4120318,-0.8324036,"
